- Open FileTaggingService/FileTaggingService.csproj in Visual Studio 2022 and build it, without running.
	- This will build an executable at .\FileTaggingService\bin\Debug\FileTaggingService.exe
- Now we need to install the FileTagging service. Open a cmd prompt as admin.
- Go to C:\windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\ directory and run `InstallUtil.exe <full path of the built executable>`
	- This will install the service on your local machine
- Now we need to start the installed service. Go to Run(Win+R) and type `services.msc`.
- In the list of services, see if `FileTagging.Model` is present(it should be, if the service installed successfully).
- Right click on `FileTagging.Model` service and click on "Start".

- Now we need to call the API exposed by the service. This is done in TestServiceApp, which is a C# console app.
- Open TestServiceApp/TestServiceApp.csproj in Visual Studio
- Build it and run it. Type any string and press Enter.
- If the FileTagging.Model service is up and running, and everything works fine, then it should print `http: <the input string reversed>`
